# UniArchive Privacy Policy

_Last updated: December 12, 2025_

UniArchive (“we”, “us”, or “our”) provides a mobile application that allows university students and academic staff to store, share, and view exam documents. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share, and protect your information when you use the UniArchive app (the “Service”).

By using UniArchive you agree to the practices described below. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Account Information
- Email address (required to create and access your UniArchive account)
- Password (stored using Supabase Authentication; we never see or store the plain text password)

### 1.2 Content You Provide
- Uploaded PDF or other exam documents
- Metadata you enter for those files (e.g., university, faculty, course, exam notes)
- Comments or additional descriptions attached to uploaded resources

### 1.3 Usage Data
- Device information (model, OS version) and basic diagnostics automatically collected by Expo/React Native runtime
- Log data, request metadata, and error traces generated when you interact with the Service
- Aggregate analytics on how features are used (e.g., search frequency, upload counts)

### 1.4 Storage Data
- Offline copies of limited data stored on your device via AsyncStorage to maintain session state

We do not collect sensitive personal information such as government identifiers, precise location, or financial data.

## 2. How We Use Information

We use your information to:
1. Create and maintain your UniArchive account
2. Authenticate and authorize access to exam archives
3. Store and display the educational content you upload
4. Provide search, filtering, and navigation features
5. Send essential service messages (e.g., verification emails, security alerts)
6. Monitor app stability, detect abuse, and prevent fraud
7. Improve the Service through analytics, bug fixing, and feature development

## 3. Legal Bases for Processing

Depending on your region, we rely on one or more of the following bases:
- Performance of a contract: to provide the UniArchive Service you requested
- Legitimate interests: securing our systems, improving features, preventing misuse
- Consent: where required for communications or optional features
- Compliance with legal obligations

## 4. Sharing & Third Parties

We do not sell your personal data. We share information only with:

- **Supabase** – provides authentication, database, and storage infrastructure located in data centers selected in your Supabase project. Your email, hashed password, metadata, and uploaded files are stored there.
- **Expo / React Native services** – used for crash reports, diagnostics, and over-the-air updates.
- **Service providers** – vetted partners offering analytics, error logging, or security tooling (if used in the future, they will only receive the minimum data needed to deliver their service).
- **Legal authorities** – when required to comply with applicable laws, enforce our policies, or protect rights and safety.

All partners are required to handle your data in line with this Policy and applicable regulations.

## 5. Data Retention

- Account and document data remain active until you delete them or request account deletion.
- Backups and logs are retained for up to 180 days unless longer retention is required for legal or security reasons.
- When you delete content, we remove it from active systems immediately and purge it from backups within the standard retention cycle.

## 6. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

- Access a copy of your data
- Correct inaccurate information
- Delete your data or account
- Restrict or object to certain processing
- Export your data in a portable format

To exercise these rights, contact us at **support@uniarchive.app**. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.

## 7. Data Security

We implement technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including:
- Encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)
- Supabase-managed authentication with hashed passwords
- Row-Level Security (RLS) to ensure uploaded content is accessible only to authorized users
- Least-privilege access for team members and service accounts

No system is completely secure; please keep your credentials confidential and let us know if you suspect unauthorized activity.

## 8. Children’s Privacy

UniArchive is intended for university-level students and academic personnel. We do not knowingly collect data from individuals under 16 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). If you believe a minor has provided personal data, contact us so we can remove it.

## 9. International Data Transfers

Your information may be stored on servers located outside your country (e.g., Supabase data centers in the EU or US). We rely on contractual safeguards and industry-standard practices to protect personal data when it is transferred internationally.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are material, we will notify you via the app or by email. Continued use of the Service after the effective date of the update constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
